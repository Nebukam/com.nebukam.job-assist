# N:JobAssist
#### Helper library for Unity's Job System

N:JobAssist is a mini-library that help streamlining interactions with Unity's Job System through wrappers, grouping and chaining automation.
It was initially made for [**N:ORCA**](https://github.com/Nebukam/com.nebukam.orca) & [**N:Geom**](https://github.com/Nebukam/com.nebukam.geom), but ended in its own package for practical purposes.
